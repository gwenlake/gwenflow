## Why Gwenflow?

Gwenflow, a framework designed by [Gwenlake](https://gwenlake.com), 
streamlines the creation of customized, production-ready applications built around Agents and
Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides developers with the tools necessary
to integrate LLMs and Agents, enabling efficient and
scalable solutions tailored to specific business or user needs.

## Installation

Install from the main branch to try the newest features:

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/gwenlake/gwenflow.git@main
```

## Usage

Load your OpenAI api key from an environment variable:

```python
import os
from gwenflow import ChatOpenAI


llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

or load your api key from a local .env file:

```python
import os
import dotenv
from gwenflow import ChatOpenAI

dotenv.load_dotenv(override=True) # load you api key from .env

llm = ChatOpenAI()
```

## Chat

```python
import os
from gwenflow import ChatOpenAI

dotenv.load_dotenv(override=True) # load you api key from .env

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Describe Argentina in one sentence."
    }
]

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
print( llm.invoke(messages=messages) )
```

## Agents, Tasks and Tools

```python
import requests
import json
import dotenv

from gwenflow import ChatOpenAI, Agent, Task


dotenv.load_dotenv(override=True) # load you api key from .env


# Tool to get current exchange rate from floatrates.com
def getfx(currency_iso: str) -> str:
    """Get the current exchange rate for a given currency. Currency MUST be in iso format."""
    try:
        response = requests.get("http://www.floatrates.com/daily/usd.json").json()
        data = response[currency_iso.lower()]
        return json.dumps(data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Currency not found: {currency_iso}")
    return "Currency not found"


# LLM and Agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

agentfx = Agent(
    role="Fx Analyst",
    instructions="Get recent exchange rates data.",
    llm=llm,
    tools=[getfx],
)

# Loop on a list of tasks
queries = [
    "Find the capital city of France?",
    "What's the exchange rate of the Brazilian real?",
    "What's the exchange rate of the Euro?",
    "What's the exchange rate of the Chine Renminbi?",
    "What's the exchange rate of the Chinese Yuan?",
    "What's the exchange rate of the Tonga?"
]

for query in queries:
    task = Task(
        description=query,
        expected_output="Answer in one sentence and if there is a date, mention this date.",
        agent=agentfx
    )
    print("")
    print("Q:", query)
    print("A:", task.run())
