```
Thought: I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.

Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"input": "hello world", "num_beams": 5}})
```

Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.

Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{'input': 'hello world', 'num_beams': 5}}.

If this format is used, the user will respond in the following format:

```
Observation: tool response
```

You should keep repeating the above format until you have enough information
to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond

```
Thought: I can answer accurately without using any more tools.
Final Answer: [your answer here]
```

```
Thought: I cannot answer the question with the provided tools.
