Here’s a basic recipe for classic chocolate chip cookies:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n- 3/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 2 large eggs\n- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or your choice)\n- Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (like walnuts or pecans)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\n2. **Mix Wet Ingredients**: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time.\n\n3. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.\n\n4. **Combine Mixtures**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n\n5. **Add Chocolate Chips**: Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed.\n\n6. **Scoop the Dough**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie to allow for spreading.\n\n7. **Bake**: Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked; they will continue to cook on the baking sheet after being removed from the oven.\n\n8. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.\n\n### Tips:\n- For softer cookies, do not overbake them.\n- You can chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking for thicker cookies.\n- Experiment with different types of chocolate chips or add-ins like dried fruit or coconut.\n\nEnjoy your homemade cookies!",
